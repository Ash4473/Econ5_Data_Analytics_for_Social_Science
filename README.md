# Econ5_Data_Analytics_for_Social_Science
This repository contains teaching material for a lower divisional class at UCSD, called Econ5/Poli5D: Data Analytics for Social Science. The objective of the class is to teach basic coding skills for data analysis in Social Sciences. The course begins with understanding how to look up data in Excel and do some basic operations of matching and vlookup. Next, coding  is introduced through STATA where students perform data wrangling, visualization, data description and regressions. Finally, the course ends up with another round of data visualization techniques (including map making) and data analysis (including regressions) in R.
