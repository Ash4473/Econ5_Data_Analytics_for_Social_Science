## Today: Introduction to ```R``` and ```RStudio```

By the end of today's lecture, you should be able to:

- Locate and identify the essential parts of the RStudio interface
- Create, edit, and save .R and .RData files
- Generate objects and differentiate between datasets, numbers, strings, and functions


## ```RStudio``` Interface

## Arithmetic Operations

```R``` can be used as a calculator:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
5 + 3

5 / 3

5 ^ 3
```
- The [1] is telling you the row number. 

## ```R``` is an "object-oriented" programming language

*Objects*, any pieces of information stored by ```R```, can be:

- A dataset (e.g. resume)
- A subset of a dataset (e.g. just the even observations of resume)
- A number (e.g. $2\pi + 1$)
- A text string (e.g. "UCSD is awesome")
- A function (e.g. a function that takes in $x$ and gives you $x^2 + 8$)

## Creating objects

```R``` can store *objects* with a name of our choice. Use ```<-``` as an assignment operator for objects.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
object_1 <- 5 + 3
object_1
```

If we assign a new value to the same object name, then we will overwrite this object (so be careful when doing so!)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
object_1 <- 5 - 3
object_1
```

## Objects (cont.)

```R``` can also represent other types of values as objects, such as strings of characters:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
MySchool <- "UCSD"
MySchool
```



## A *vector* represents a collection of information stored in a specific order

We use the function ```c()```, which stands for "concatenate," to enter a data vector (with commas separating elements of the vector):

```{r, echo = TRUE}
vector.1 <- c(93, 92, 83, 99, 96, 97)
vector.1
```
- Note: when creating a vector, R creates column vectors $(n \times 1)$

## Vectors (cont.)

To access specific elements of a vector, we use square brackets  
```[ ]```. This is called *indexing*:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
vector.1[2]

vector.1[c(2, 4)]

vector.1[-4]
```

## Vectors (cont.)

Since each element of this vector is a numeric value, we can apply arithmetic operations to it:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
vector.1 * 1000
```

## Element-corresponding operations with vectors

```{r, echo = TRUE}
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3); vec2 <- c(3, 3, 3)
vec1 + vec2
vec1 * vec2
vec1 / vec2
```

## Functions

A *function* takes input object(s) and returns an output object. In ```R```, a function generally runs as ```funcname(input)```. Some basic functions useful for summarizing data include:

- ```length()```: length of a vector (number of elements)
- ```min()```: minimum value
- ```max()```: maximum value
- ```range()```: range of data
- ```mean()```: mean
- ```sum()```: sum

Try these with ```vector.1```  

## Functions (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
length(vector.1)

min(vector.1)

max(vector.1)
```

## Functions (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
range(vector.1)

mean(vector.1)

sum(vector.1)
```

## Like Stata, we need to specify a working directory in ```R```

- Use the function ```setwd()``` to change the working directory

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
setwd("path")
```

- Use the function ```getwd()``` to display the current working directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
getwd()
```
```## [1] path```

## Loading data from your working directory

- For *CSV* files:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
resume <- read.csv("resume.csv")
```

- For *RData* files:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
resume <- load("resume.RData")
```

## Data Frames

A *data frame* is a collection of vectors, but we can think of it like an Excel spreadsheet. Useful functions for data frames include:

- ```names()```: return a vector of variable names
- ```nrow()```: return the number of rows
- ```ncol()```: return the number of columns
- ```dim()```: combine ```ncol()``` and ```nrow()``` into a vector
- ```summary()```: produce a summary
- ```head()```: displays the first six observations
- ```tail()```: displays the last six observations

Load ```resume.csv```, assign it to an object called ```resume```, and try the above functions on this newly created data frame.

## Data Frames (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
names(resume)

nrow(resume)

ncol(resume)
```

## Data Frames (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dim(resume)

summary(resume)
```

## Data Frames (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(resume)

tail(resume)
```

## Data Frames: using []

We can retrieve specified observations and variables using brackets ```[ ]``` with a comma in the form ```[rows, columns]```:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
resume[1:3, "firstname"]

resume[1:3, 2]
```

Observe that "firstname" is the second variable in the "resume" data frame.

## Data Frames: using $

The ```$``` operator is another way to access variables from a data frame:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(resume$firstname, 3)
```

Note: the "3" after the comma specifies how many observations to display.

## Saving Objects

When you quit ```RStudio```, you will be asked whether you would like to save the workspace. You should answer *no* to this in general: we only want to save what we want!

- To export *CSV*:
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
write.csv(resume, file = "resume.csv")
```

- To export *RData*:
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
save(resume, file = "resume.RData")
```

Go ahead and export your data frame as RData. 

## Here are the commands/operators we covered today:

- ```<-```
- ```c()```
- ```vector[]```
- ```length(), min(), max(), range(), mean(), sum()```
- ```head(), tail()```
- ```setwd(), getwd()```
- ```read.csv(), load()```
- ```names(), nrow(), ncol(), dim(), summary()```
- ```write.csv(), save()```
- ```$```
